## Introduction
Sepsis is a life-threatening illness caused by your body’s response to an infection. Your immune system protects you from many illnesses and infections, but it’s also possible for it to go into overdrive in response to an infection. Sepsis develops when the chemicals the immune system releases into the bloodstream to fight an infection cause inflammation throughout the entire body instead. Severe cases of sepsis can lead to septic shock, which is a medical emergency. Around 30 millions individuals create sepsis and one-fifth of them die from the infection consistently around the globe. Distinguishing sepsis early and beginning quick treatment frequently spare patients lives.
